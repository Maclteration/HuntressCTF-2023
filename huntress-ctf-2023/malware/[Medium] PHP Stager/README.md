# Description

Ugh, we found PHP set up as an autorun to stage some other weird shady stuff. Can you unravel the payload?

**NOTE:** this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. Huntress had done their best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

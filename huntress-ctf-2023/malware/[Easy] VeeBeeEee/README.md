# Description

While investigating a host, we found this strange file attached to a scheduled task. It was invoked with wscript or something... can you find a flag?

**NOTE:** this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. Huntress had done their best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

## Flag

`flag{ed81d24958127a2adccfb343012cebff}`

# Solution

1. It’s in the description that the malware was invoked with `wscript`. After searching wscript decode, I stumbled upon this link

- https://master.ayra.ch/vbs/vbs.aspx

2. The decoder only accepts `.vbe` file extension, so I changed `veebeeeee`  file into `veebeeeee.vbe`

3. Clean the output of the decoded .vbe file by removing `’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’‘`, `al37ysoeopm` and `&`

4. Combining the value of `Reqest1 to Reqest3` will make a link to pastebin

5. The pastebin link contains the flag

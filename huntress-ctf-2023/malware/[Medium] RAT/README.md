# Description

I was arguing with a co-worker on whether or not it is "Remote Access Tool" or "Remote Access Trojan", and he didn't agree with me, so I sent him this shady file ;)

**NOTE:** this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. Huntress had done their best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

## Flag

`flag{8b988b859588f2725f0c859104919019}`

# Solution

1. Get the hashes using tools like `hashmyfile`

2. Upload the hash to `virustotal`

3. Search for the flag

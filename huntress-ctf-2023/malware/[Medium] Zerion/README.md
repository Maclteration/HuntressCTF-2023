# Description

We observed some odd network traffic, and found this file on our web server... can you find the strange domains that our systems are reaching out to?

**NOTE:** this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. Huntress had done their best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

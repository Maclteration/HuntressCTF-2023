# Description

Ugh, we found PHP set up as an autorun to stage some other weird shady stuff. Can you unravel the payload?

**NOTE:** this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. Huntress had done their best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

## Flag

`flag{092744b55420033c5eb9d609eac5e823}`

# Solution

1. Run the executable and use strings on `the-entire-text-of-hamlet.txt.encry`

2. There seems to be a pattern, a text repeating itself `COSMOBOI`

3. I tried cosmoboi as password and it worked

4. open `flag.txt.decry`

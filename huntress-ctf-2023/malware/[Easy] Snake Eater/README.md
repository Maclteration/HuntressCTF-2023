Hey Analyst, I've never seen an executable icon that looks like this. I don't like things I'm not familiar with. Can you check it out and see what it's doing?

**NOTE:** this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. Huntress had done their best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

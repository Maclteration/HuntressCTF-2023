# Description

You’ve been asked to audit the Microsoft 365 activity for a recently onboarded as a customer of your MSP. Your new customer is afraid that Debra was compromised. We received logs exported from Purview… can you figure out what the threat actor did? It might take some clever log-fu!

## Flag

# Solution

1. Go to the end of line 145

2. See the pattern of the flag vertically

3. Type per letter and it will spell the flag
